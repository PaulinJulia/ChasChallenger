## Description

This project is a web application inspired by Dungeons & Dragons where the user can create accounts, log in, create and generate characters with the help of AI and participate in a story based on the Swedish brochure "Om krisen eller kriget kommer". The game is chat based, where AI acts as narrator, guiding the story and determining the success of characters in various scenarios.


In this project, we have used a range of tools and libraries. For the UI, we used React along with Redux toolkit for state management. Axios was used for API requests, while Tailwind and CSS modules handled the styling. For form handling we used react-hook form, and for routing we implemented React Router. During a part of the project a json server was used for the backend of the REST API. Our development environment was managed with Vite for module bundling, and some TypeScript was used to provide type safety.
